Lightweight fork of the well known kiss_fft library. I only kept the C++ header,
everything else got stripped down, even the tests. The original test suite wasn't 
written in a portable code so I'll try to provide one.

I've added a simple CMakeLists (hugely inspired by nlohmann's json.hpp packaging)
so that it can be accessed easily from CLion.
